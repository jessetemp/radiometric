- [ ] ~~Sync hover highlighting between table and timeline~~ Looks weird because Uranium is so common
- [x] Add element labels to timeline
- [ ] **~~Get user feedback~~** Thanks for literally nothing reddit. Try again elsewhere I guess
- [ ] Use SASS (or other CSS compiler)
- [ ] Add color [noise](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4011113/can-you-add-noise-to-a-css3-gradient)
- [ ] Add CRT frame effect
