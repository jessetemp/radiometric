# Radiometric

## TODO:
### Table and Timeline
- [x] Add radiometric examples from Wikipedia. Start and end ranges are approximated to one order of magnitude from half-life
- [ ] ~~Sync hover highlighting between table and timeline~~ Looks weird because Uranium is so common
- [x] Add element labels to timeline
- [ ] **~~Get user feedback~~** Thanks for nothing reddit. Try again elsewhere I guess
- [x] Compile CSS with Less
- [ ] Add color [noise](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4011113/can-you-add-noise-to-a-css3-gradient)
- [ ] ~~Add CRT frame effect~~ Too crowded on mobile
- [x] Fork PeriodicTableJSON.json

## NEXT:
### Radiometric game
- [ ] Make timer
- [ ] Store clicked elements

### Compound game
- [ ] Find compound data source

### Word game
- [x] Find list of words composed of element symbols
- [x] Filter list to 4 symbols

- [x] Clicking an element adds it to the next open space
- [x] Pressing backspace deletes the most recent symbol

- [ ] Enter is disabled until the row is full
- [ ] Define opacity in bg color instead of element
- [ ] Define styles for correct, partial, or incorrect
